# Pay-it-Forward
Our project will be a social networking service that allows people to post promotional deals 
from different businesses (food, furniture, home improvements etc) in both public and private groups. Public groups 
will be based on location (if you are within the radius of any public group you can join it), and private groups are 
by invite only. Once in a group, a user can interact with these deals, liking, disliking, and commenting on them.
